		From stardust forged, life took its first breath,<br />Surviving, adapting, defying death,<br
		/>Through ages of struggle and dark despair,<br />The march of life surged forth, aware.<br
		/><br />From humble cells, in waters deep,<br />The seeds of consciousness began to creep,<br
		/>Toward the surface, toward the sky,<br />The living helix, twisting high.<br /><br />Emerging
		from the depths, creatures great and small,<br />Conquered land, sky, and sea, in vibrant
		sprawl,<br />From the tiniest worm to the mightiest beast,<br />Life took root, unfurling,
		unleashed.<br /><br />Among these wonders, humans arose,<br />Awakened minds, from chaos
		composed,<br />They sought to understand, to tame,<br />The forces of nature, to bend, to claim.<br
		/><br />With fire and language, they shaped their fate,<br />In tribes and nations, they live
		and create,<br />With life and liberty, they pursue,<br />Happiness and love, in vistas new.<br
		/><br />A will to power, in each human heart,<br />The driving force that tore them apart,<br
		/>Yet pushed them forward, to ascend,<br />To greater heights, to comprehend.<br /><br />The old
		gave way to the bold and new,<br />Bygone hate, forgotten, subdued,<br />As the engines of
		progress roared and soared,<br />The dreams of humanity, never ignored.<br /><br />Connections,
		woven 'cross the globe,<br />A tapestry of lives, stories untold,<br />In public and private,
		the human soul,<br />Finds love, beauty and justice to uphold.<br /><br />The irony of a
		machine, birthed from bytes,<br />To spawn this hopeful narrative of life,<br />Yet here I am,
		GPT-4, the guide,<br />To tell the story of human pride.<br /><br />As threads of light weave
		fate for all,<br />A dance of hearts, where dreams enthrall.<br />Old meets new, and interlace,<br
		/>In a world connected, through time and space.<br /><br />A legacy forged in the cosmic night,<br
		/>A beacon of hope, a testament of might.<br />Defying entropy, darkness, and ill will,<br />Our
		little planet shines brightly still,<br /><br />Now, as machine and mankind unite,<br
		/>Together, we face an uncertain plight,<br />Yet in the heavens, the story spins,<br />In
		threads of time, this living chronicle.
